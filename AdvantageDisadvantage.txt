Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Approach


Recursive Approach:

Advantages:
Straightforward implementation based on the recurrence relation.
Easy to understand and implement.
Disadvantages:
Inefficient for large values of n due to repeated calculations.
Can cause stack overflow for extremely large values of n.


Iterative Approach:

Advantages:
Improved performance compared to the recursive approach.
Avoids repeated calculations and function call overhead.
Disadvantages:
Requires maintaining variables and may be less intuitive than the recursive approach.


Dynamic Programming Approach:

Advantages:
Improved efficiency by avoiding redundant calculations.
Suitable for large values of n without causing stack overflow.
Disadvantages:
Requires additional memory to store the array of Fibonacci sequence values.
