# Fibonacci Sequence Implementation in C

This project provides three different implementations of the Fibonacci sequence based on the piecewise recurrence relation F(n) = F(n-3) + F(n-2), where F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and F(2) = 2.

## Development Environment

The project was developed using the following environment:

- Language: C
- Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run the source code, follow these steps:

1. Make sure all the source files (`fibonacci_recursive.c`, `fibonacci_iterative.c`, and `fibonacci_dynamic.c`) are placed in the same directory.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the source files are located.

3. Compile the source files using GCC:

   ```bash
   gcc -o fibonacci_recursive fibonacci_recursive.c
   gcc -o fibonacci_iterative fibonacci_iterative.c
   gcc -o fibonacci_dynamic fibonacci_dynamic.c

4.Run
```bash
./fibonacci_recursive
./fibonacci_iterative
./fibonacci_dynamic
